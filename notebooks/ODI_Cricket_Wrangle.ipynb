    "There is a vast amount of data collected within cricket. Every ball bowled represents a potentially interesting data point (runs scored, wickets taken), and each has the potential to follow patterns. This project will attempt to identify these patterns through various machine learning techniques, and see what it really takes to win a cricket match.\n",

    "In the One Day Internation (ODI) format, the team batting first will have 50 overs (6 balls in an over) to amas as higher score as possible whilst the other team attempt to take wickets and limit their score. The second team will then have 50 overs to try and chase down that score. Either team can lose a maximum of 10 wickets within the 50 over innings."

This was the best bowling performance they have put up in quite a while, and they'll have a bounce in their step when the two teams meet for their next match, on Tuesday, May 21. Join us live for that one, but until then, it's goodbye from us.\\n\\n<b>Gulbandin Naib:</b> The boys did really well in the field, but credit goes to Ireland, they bowled really well. Stirling and Porterfield batted really well, they put on a 100 partnership (99) and that's why they got a good score.\\n\\n<b>William Porterfield:</b> Very much so (happy). We played some very good cricket in patches earlier. Here also at half-time we thought we were a bit short to be honest. We've built up a pretty good relation (him and Stirling), we know each other well. Very satisfied with our performance, and taking 10 wickets was very pleasing. You rarely run through a side, they were always going to get a partnership. I wanted Boyd (Rankin) to be as aggressive as possible.\\n\\n<b>5.35pm:</b> Ireland looked like they had not got enough on the board. They were looking good for 240-250, but ended up with just 210. But their bowlers were magnificent, and weathered a threatening stand between Asghar Afghan and Mohammad Nabi.\\n\\nIreland's last ODI win was also against Afghanistan, but came back in March, <a href=\\\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19052/scorecard/1168119/afghanistan-vs-ireland-5th-odi-afg-v-ire-2018-19\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">in Dehradun</a>. Since then they've played five ODIs without tasting victory - four defeats and one abandonment. \\n\\n<b>5.32pm:</b> Great win for Ireland, they've been waiting for a win for some time now. This was driven by the bowlers, starting with Tim Murtagh, then with Andy McBrine's ten overs on the trot, and down to Mark Adair's strikes and even the veteran Boyd Rankin putting a horror start behind him to strike back.
