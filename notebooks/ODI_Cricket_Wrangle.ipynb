    "There is a vast amount of data collected within cricket. Every ball bowled represents a potentially interesting data point (runs scored, wickets taken), and each has the potential to follow patterns. This project will attempt to identify these patterns through various machine learning techniques, and see what it really takes to win a cricket match.\n",

    "In the One Day Internation (ODI) format, the team batting first will have 50 overs (6 balls in an over) to amas as higher score as possible whilst the other team attempt to take wickets and limit their score. The second team will then have 50 overs to try and chase down that score. Either team can lose a maximum of 10 wickets within the 50 over innings."

    "- `BR` has 606 null value entries.\n",
    "- \"-\" is used in place of NaN in `Margin`, `Toss`, `Bat` and `Result` columns\n",
    "- `Start Date` not in datetime format.\n",
    "- `Result`, `Toss`, `Bat` columns should be categorical type instead of object.\n",
    "- `Match_ID` has common prefix \"ODI #\".\n",
    "- some `Match_ID` values have suffix \"a\".\n",
    "- `Margin` has \"runs\" and \"wickets\" suffixes to describe the winning method. Need to separate these to convert to integer.\n",
    "- `Opposition` column has common prefix \"v _Country_\"\n",
    "- `Result` has multiple entries likely to mean match abandoned. \\['n/r', 'aban', 'canc'\\].\n",
    "- Multiple spellings for Sri Lanka, New Zealand, e.g \"SriLanka\" & \"Sri Lanka\". Not all double barrelled country names are sepearated with a space.\n",

    "- `Result` and `RPO` have \"-\" in place of NaN values\n",
    "- `Target` has 676 NaN values because the team batting first does not have a target score.\n",

    "### `df_totals` Cleanliness\n",
    "- Column names include capital letters and whitsepace characters.\n",
    "- `Unnamed: 0` appears to be an old index which is no longer useful.\n",
    "- `Score` is type object because it is sometimes given in the format \"###/#\" where the number after \"/\" is the amount of wickets lost. \n",
    "- `Result` and `RPO` have \"-\" in place of NaN values\n",
    "- `Target` has 676 NaN values because the team batting first does not have a target score.\n",
    "- `Inns` is a non-descriptive term for \"innings batted\".\n",
    "- `Inns` has some zero values associated with abandoned matches\n",
    "- `RPO` is type object, should by type float.\n",
    "- `Start Date` not in datetime format.\n",
    "- `Result`, `Inns` columns should be categorical type.\n",
    "- `Match_ID` has common prefix \"ODI #\".\n",
    "- `Opposition` column has common prefix \"v _Country_\"\n",
    "- 554 matches are represented by 2 rows of data, and 188 matches are represented by a single row of data. Most data can be inferred from the single row but some might be missing.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Tidiness\n",
    "- Columns duplicated between `df_match` and `df_totals`: `Start Date`, `Ground`, `Match_ID`, `Country`, `Country_ID`, `Opposition`, `Result`.\n",
    "- Some data across both tables can be inferred from other columns and therefore are not independant variables. Related columns: `Score`, `Overs`, `RPO`, `BR`, `Target`, `Margin`\n",
    "- Data can be restructured into 2 tables with only the `Match_ID` column common between them. \n",
    "***\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    " 1. Restructure data so that we have 2 new DataFrames; `df_match_clean`, `df_totals_clean`.\n",
    "     - `df_match_clean`:\n",
    "         - columns: `match_id`, `start_date`, `team1`, `team2`, `ground`, `result`\n",
    "         - Each match represented by a single row\n",
    "         - `result` column will contain the winning team for all completed games that were not tied.\n",
    "     - `df_totals_clean`:\n",
    "         - columns: `match_id`, `team`, `opposition`, `toss`, `innings`, `score`, `overs`, `rpo`, `result`, `win_margin`, `win_method`\n",
    "         - Each match will be represented by two rows of data, one for each team.\n",
    "         - `result` column will contain \"win, lose, draw, n/r\" categorical data.\n",
    "         <br>\n",
    "         <br>\n",
    " 2. Implement and test cleaning code on the `df_match_clean` and `df_totals_clean` to address cleanliness issues."
