# ODI_cricket

With the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup now in full swing, I wanted to dig a
little deeper into the statistics behind this weird and wonderful game.

There is a vast amount of data collected within cricket. Every ball bowled
represents a potentially interesting data point (runs scored, wickets taken),
and each has the potential to follow patterns. This project will attempt to
identify these patterns through various machine learning techniques, and see
what it really takes to win a cricket match.

In the One Day Internation (ODI) format, the team batting first will have 50
overs (6 balls in an over) to amas as higher score as possible whilst the other
team attempt to take wickets and limit their score. The second team will then
have 50 overs to try and chase down that score. Either team can lose a maximum
of 10 wickets within the 50 over innings.

The structure of this project has been set up using cookiecutter.
